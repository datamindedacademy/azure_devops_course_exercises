# Hand's On Azure Boards

## Introduction 
In the following steps you will get familiar with azure boards by getting your hands dirty.
We will go over most of the important features, and you will apply them in a project that touches every
major component in azure devops. As eager to start as I am? Let's go!

### Creating items
We will start with creating some items. 

1. Create an Epic with your name and stating: `$YOUR_NAME$ Finishing the devops course`
2. Assign yourself to the epic
3. Set it to priority 1
4. Give it a description
5. Create issues for each of the parts we will og over in this course
While doing so make sure to:
   1. assign the epic you created as a parent to all of your issues.
   2. Make also sure you are assigned to all of your issues/epic.
   3. Issues to create:
      1. `$YOUR_NAME$  Hands on: Boards`
      2. `$YOUR_NAME$  Hands on: Repos`
      3. `$YOUR_NAME$  Hands on: Classic Pipelines` 
      4. `$YOUR_NAME$  Hands on: YAML Pipelines` 
      5. `$YOUR_NAME$  Hands on: Test Plans` 

### Updating items
Let's do some updates to an item!

1. Filter so you can only see the issues assigned to you
2. Drag your `$NAME$: Hands On Boards` item to the doing column
3. Open the issue
4. Add a few tags that seem appropriate
5. Add the following tasks:
   1. Work items 
   2. Boards 
   3. Sprints 
   4. Queries 
6. Assign it a higher priority (lower is higher)
7. Add to the description of the `$NAME$ Hands On: Repos` a link to the `$NAME$: Hands On Boards`  issue in the description with (Successor/Predecessor)
8. Add a personal touch to the board with the use of the settings seen before, go wild!


### Creating sprints
Since you all know what agile is, lets try to adopt it.

1. Go to Sprints
2. Define 2 new Sprint Iterations
   1. Choose a name that includes your name! (for both)
   2. Create one for today and one for next week.
3. Go to backlogs and assign your items to the correct sprint. 

### Creating Queries
We have so much tickets on our board... Let's simplify!

1. Create a query that shows all work items that are:
   1. assigned to you 
   2. in the “Doing” state
2. Save this query and choose a name 
3. Verify 
4. Email the result to yourself 
5. Make sure you can see the priority of all the work items 
6. Create a chart where you can see all the results grouped by their priorities 
7. Make sure that you can also see the other linked work items

### All Done?
If you successfully completed the previous steps, it's time to update your issue `$YOUR_NAME$  Hands on: Boards`
and set it state on done! 
It is important to make sure you keep the board up-to-date.
