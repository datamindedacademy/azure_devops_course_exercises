# Hands On Azure Boards

## Introduction 
In this part of the course we will take a look at Azure Repo's and get a little bit of 
hands-on experience. You can complete the hands on in browser or in your IDE of choice.


### My First Commit
In this first hands on we will do a simple commit to our own repo.
Some of you might be very familiar, others less. But to go over the
basics can't hurt!

1. Fork the existing repo and give it a unique name (add your name)
2. Create a new branch, give it a name with regard to a new feature called anonymous greeting.
Checkout this branch.
3. In the file `src/hello_world/azure_functions/hello_world/__init__.py` change the string where it says `TODO` with a greeting you create.
4. Commit the changes.
5. Push the changes to your branch
6. Create a PR and assign one of your fellow students.

### Linking work items
We want to make sure to link our boards and repos as much as possible! 

1. Drag the ticket: `“$NAME$ Hands on: Repos”` to doing
2. Link your branch you created earlier to the ticket


### Acting on a PR
There is more than creating PR's, they of course need reviewing too!

1. Go to the PR that was assigned to you
2. Comment on the string he had to change. If they made a mistake? Correct it, if not maybe propose another sentence or something you would personally change.
3. Go back to your own PR, read what was said and complete the PR.
4. Go check in boards what happened to your item.
